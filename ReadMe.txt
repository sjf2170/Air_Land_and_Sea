Taking inspiration from other games, which have been optimized using reward-based learning models, I decided to create and optimize a game I recently discovered, called Air, Land, and Sea.  First, I built a rudimentary game engine to replicate the game Air, Land, and Sea, which later would be adapted for applications in reward-based machine learning.  The reward-based learning program can be found in the file “Air_Land_and_Sea_Class_RL”.  The goal of the project was to use RL to create an agent that can win against a player using random actions at least 50% of the time.  Please enjoy both playing the game (Air_Land_and_Sea_Engine) and exploring the Reward-based learning algorithm.
